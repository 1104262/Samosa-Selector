# Samosa Selector Project

## Overview

Samosa Selector is a game, built with React, Vite, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, that is based on an incremental game called Cookie Clicker. The goal of the game is to produce as many cookies by clicking on the Big Cookie as you can. However, in this version, instead of clicking a cookie, the user will be selecting a delicious samosa.



## Gameplay

The game starts out with the user having zero samosas. The user has the option to click the Big Samosa, which initially produces one samosa per click. When the user has 10 samosas, they can buy a Double Stuffed upgrade, which produces double the amount of samosas per click. When the user has 100 samosas, they can buy the Party Pack upgrade, which produces 5x the amount of samosas per click. When the user has 1000 samosas, they can buy the Full Feast upgrade, which produces 10x the amount of samosas per click. The game continue on forever and the user continues to gain gigantic amounts of samosas. Yum!
